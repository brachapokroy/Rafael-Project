# RfaelProject
This project gets data of all kinds of rockets and can  identify each type by machine learning
It's an introduction to machine learning.
We have experienced all types of models for training and  watched witch one gave us the best results
Then we had to play around with the columns that are the most necessary.
We had to check it out what are the strongest features for every type
