# RfaelProject
This project gets data of all kinds of rockets and can  identify each type by training a model  of machine learning by its features.
It's an introduction to machine learning.
We have experienced all types of models for training and watched which one gave us the best results using a confusion matrix.
Then we had to play around with the columns that are the most necessary and the features that are most accurate.
We had to check out what the strongest features are for every type of rocket.
We then added a column of energy by calculating its energy according to the formula of energy.
That gave better results since the rocket type is very dependent on the energy.
